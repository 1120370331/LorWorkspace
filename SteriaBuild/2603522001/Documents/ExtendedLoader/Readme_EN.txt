1) New class LorName (in LorIdExtensions): analog of LorId for strings; currently used just for skin identification, but could do more.
2) A number of skin-changing functions utilising LorName, to make it possible to change to any skin from other mod.You can use this function like this:
owner.view.ChangeSkin(new LorName("ModId","SkinName"));
owner.view.ChangeSkin("ModId:SkinName");
3) Face components such as the eyes mouth and hair of the character can be attached at the same time. Img files size are also not limited by the size of 512*512, but you need to place them in the center of the picture. Enemies can also use these face components (and assigned colors) when they have no own customization data, decreasing the need to make pairs of enemy/player skins.
4) Extended skin format with new features: "full-back" sprites that go behind back hair, skin sprites that properly recolour with the librarian, "effect" layer sprites, sprites bigger than 512x512, sprites with higher pixel-per-unit density than 50f (useful when planning to scale up). It can also load previously unsupported BattleUnitView/CharacterMotion elements: additional pivots in motions, special pivots per motion type, custom pivot points for attack effects (you can set position scale and rotation for it,This feature will make the mod skin perform better when using the original effects). And it can also store motion sounds in specific skins. These are reloaded from anywhere as long as ModInfo.xml contains "extended=true", so it is possible to have bare workshop skins (or even local skins) utilizing all these features.
5) Optimization for loading skins in menus: previously it loaded simplified two-motion versions for basic skins, but full ten-motion versions for modded skins; now it loads a simplified version for modded skins too, decreasing the lag when customizing.
6) Optional preloading methods (under ExtendedLoader.SkinTools (UnitRenderUtils.dll)) - if reception is supposed to change skins later, these can be used at its start (from passive or stagemanager) to preload sprites in advance, so the game won't lag later during active gameplay.
7) Support for A/B appearances in modded books (not related to extended skins, one of them just has to end in _M or _F).
8) Fixed pumpkins/ shades breaking when copying a modded appearance, fixed thumbnails of modded pages with basic skins, fixed thumbnails of skins with front parts on default motion (it used to display only the back/middle sprite, now it combines the full thumbnail and saves it), fixed gifts showing over the front sprites on custom skins.
9) Former "Tab projection" now makes an actual UI button instead of using the Tab hotkey, so people can stop asking how to do it.
10) Fixed saved customization indexes sometimes "drifting" when new mods are installed - now customizations are reserve-saved as locations, and reserve-loaded as such, so appearance will not change after reloading (even if index might change).
